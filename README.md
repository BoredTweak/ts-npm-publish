# boredtweak-npm-test

Experimenting with publishing a Typescript package to NPM

Please don't actually depend on this.

## Build and Publish

- Login to npm via `npm login`
- Transpile the code to a publishable library by running `npm run build`
- Publish the newly generated lib code to npm via `npm publish`
- Increment the version before publishing
